## 👋 Yo!

I'm [Your Name], a frontend dev who mostly works with React. Been doing web stuff for a while now.

Lately, I’ve been getting into game dev and trying to improve as an artist (slow progress, but it’s happening). Still figuring things out, experimenting a lot, and having fun along the way.

### 🧪 What I'm messing with
- React, Redux, and the usual frontend tools
- Game dev stuff (Godot, Unity, still deciding what sticks)
- Pixel art, sketches, and sometimes 3D when I'm feeling brave

### 📝 Random goals
- Make a small game and actually finish it
- Draw something that doesn’t look cursed
- Keep learning cool stuff without burning out

### 📬 Say hi
If you're into the same things or just wanna chat, feel free to reach out.

That’s it for now. Thanks for passing by 👾
