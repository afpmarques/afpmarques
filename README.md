## ðŸ‘‹ Yo!

I'm AndrÃ©, a frontend dev who mostly works with React. I used to do full stack, but these days I mostly stick to the frontend. Been doing web stuff for a few years now.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been getting into game dev and trying to improve as an artist (slow progress, but itâ€™s happening). Still figuring things out, experimenting a lot, and having fun along the way.

### What I'm messing with
- React, Redux, and the usual frontend tools
- Game dev stuff â€“ mostly messing with Godot right now, but also trying out Unity and even some Pygame just for fun
- Pixel art (mostly in Aseprite), some sketches on paper, and maybe some 3D eventually (havenâ€™t made anything yet, but it's on the list)

### Random goals
- Make a small game and actually finish it
- Draw something that doesnâ€™t look cursed
